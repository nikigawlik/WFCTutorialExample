# WFCTutorialExample #
Example Unity project for a tutorial on level generation using the [WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse).

## Disclaimer ##
This is a simplified implementation of WFC. It is not optimised for speed, and it uses a very simple propagation method. It is written to be easy to understand and contains visualisations to illustrate the generation process.

It only conerns itself with the "Tilemap" use case of the algorithm and applies it to a set of pre-constructed rooms / level pieces.
